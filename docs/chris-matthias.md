## Who Am I?

My name is Chris Matthias and I was born in Brooklyn and raised out in Jersey.  My favorite food is pizza (groaner), my favorite color is blue and my favorite hobby is watching NY Mets games.

I'm also a full-time front end web developer.  I build fast, responsive websites and live in HTML, CSS and JS. I've got some DevOps chops as well.
